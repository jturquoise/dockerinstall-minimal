# Docker Setup Script


This Bash script is designed to automate the process of updating a server and installing Docker. It checks if curl is installed and installs it if not. It makes use of functions to handle tasks like checking if packages are installed, updating the system, and setting up Docker.

## Notice 

This script is in part or wholly created with AI. In this case, I made the majority of the code and then used AI to find out how to do things like the curl check. I find it ethically important to let people know this. This program has been tested by a human. 


## Script Overview

The script performs the following operations:

- Updates all system packages.
- Installs `curl` if it's not already installed.
- Sets up Docker by adding its GPG key and repository, and then installs it along with necessary plugins.

### Functions Used

#### `is_installed`

Checks if a specified package is already installed on the system.

**Parameters:**
- `$1` - The package name to check.

#### `system_update`

Updates and upgrades system packages using `apt-get`.

#### `install_package`

Installs a specified package using `apt-get` if it's not already installed.

**Parameters:**
- `$1` - The package name to install.

#### `add_gpg_key`

Adds a GPG key for a repository from a given URL.

**Parameters:**
- `$1` - The URL from where to fetch the GPG key.
- `$2` - The name used for the keyring file in `/etc/apt/keyrings`.

#### `add_repo`

Adds a software repository to the system's sources list.

**Parameters:**
- `$1` - Descriptive name of the repository.
- `$2` - The keyring name associated with this repository.
- `$3` - The base URL of the repository.

### Main Execution Flow

1. **System Update:**
   - Calls `system_update` to update and upgrade the system packages.

2. **Install Curl:**
   - Ensures `curl` is installed by calling `install_package "curl"`.

3. **Docker Installation:**
   - Adds Docker's GPG key and repository.
   - Installs Docker and its components (`docker-ce`, `docker-ce-cli`, `containerd.io`, `docker-buildx-plugin`, `docker-compose-plugin`).

4. **Testing Docker Installation:**
   - Tests the Docker installation by running a hello-world container.
